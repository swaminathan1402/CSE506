To test Kill

We have an idle task that does nothing but yield

1. type "kill <pid>"

The pid of idle task is 1.
After killing, type "ps".

To test "cd"

In order to change directory, kindly add a '/' at the end of the directory name

for example, "cd bin/" or "cd lib/". Not "cd lib"

After that enter "pwd" to confirm that the path has changed.
We donot print any message when invalid path is entered. We however remain at the current path itself.
